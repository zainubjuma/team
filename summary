I’m a motivated and driven IT Technician Student.
 Some of the things I like doing are going out, having a good time with my friends and family, I love swimming, dancing and there are still a few to mention. 
 I’m good at creating and editing documents, taking up any task given to me and I am a reliable person and take commitment up seriously.
  If you ask other people, they will describe me as a caring, hardworker and loving person. 
  Some of my skills are Networking, IC3 Digital Literacy and also CompTIA+, I also got certificates for the skills I have and also scored the highest for my Network examination.
   I am very interested in reading, baking and traveling. I’ve never worked before since I matriculated in 2020, I studied ever since. I volunteered before at
    Melomed Hospital it was for a project at school I did care work and I also volunteered at Cure day Clinic where I did admin work.
